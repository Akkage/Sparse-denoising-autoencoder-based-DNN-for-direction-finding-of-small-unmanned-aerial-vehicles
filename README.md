## Description
We implement the Sparse-denoising-autoencoder(SDAE) along with deep neural network proposed by authors in the reference paper to find the direction of unmanned aerial vehicles. Initially, some theoretical implementation is done using MUSIC algorithm. 

Files: main.py: main file to execute SDAE and DNN for implementation. get_csv_data.py: file to fetch training and test data from csv files for various sectors.
